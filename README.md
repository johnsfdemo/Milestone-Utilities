# Milestone Utilities

This package consists of two invocable Apex methods that can be used either in Process Builder or the Flow Builder to assist with entitlement and milestone management from a declarative standpoint.

## AssignCaseEntitlement

A case's EntitlementID can be set in Process Builder using a hard-coded ID, but these will not survive a Trialforce. **AssignCaseEntitlement** will allow you to set an entitlement to a case by its name.
